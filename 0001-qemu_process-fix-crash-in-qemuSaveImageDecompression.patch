Subject: [PATCH] qemu_process: fix crash in qemuSaveImageDecompressionStart
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Content-type: text/plain

Commit changing the code to allow passing NULL as @data into
qemuSaveImageDecompressionStart() was not correct as it left the
original call into the function as well.
